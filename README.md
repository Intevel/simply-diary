## ‚ú® About

- **Open-Source**. the project is fully open source, both backend and frontend.

## üöÄ Self-Hosted
If you want to host a Simply Diary yourself then you have to clone the two repositories first, the backend and the frontend. 

```sh
Frontend: git clone https://github.com/cnrycodes/simply-diary.git
Backend: git clone https://github.com/cnrycodes/simply-diary-server.git
```

First we start the backend, navigate to your folder:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The backend should now start on port 8080 if the port has not been changed.

Now we start the frontend, navigate to your folder:

```sh
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to change the API Urls in the Frontend Source Code ‚ö†Ô∏è
